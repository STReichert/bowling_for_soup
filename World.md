An [interactive map of Wildemount](https://redgiantmaps.com/maps/wildemount) that has more detail. Note: the information in pop ups is not necessarily true of our actual campaign setting. [This map](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/wildemount-nemuvent/map/13063f2c-1e2c-4e60-94e0-4606c6dbe6f7) also is really good with a bit more zoom in detail
