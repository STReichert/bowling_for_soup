Back when [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]] was at the height of power. An Elvish warrior found an object of great power, but he did not know that it was an arm of the Betrayers, the Mace of Bane. It was imbued with the soul of a fiend under Bane, it subjected him to it's will. He sought assistance from the coven of hags but didn't do diligence and he only got information for how to "break" the item but not destroy it.

He ended up accidentally doing the Hag's bidding. He got enough information to break the mace but not destroy it, and the power was released causing the corruption. The hags then used this power that was spilling out to create [[Ruby (of Power)|Ruby]]
