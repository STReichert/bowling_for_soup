How do we destroy the sword that [[Yarrowish]] is residing in? He is pretty chill so unclear how big of a priority this is. It is an arm of the betrayer god [[Groomsch]] with the demon Yarrowish residing in it. Aust is bonded to it and destroying it is the only way to unbond them from what we can tell.

Someone had broken but did not fully destroy an arm of the betrayer god Bane and the hags had used the power to create the corruption.
