The [[Savalier Wood]] for several hundred years has been growing dark, dangerous and mysterious as purply vines encroach upon the trees and monsters roam the woods. The deeper into the woods one goes the more dangerous it becomes. This appears to be centered on the [[Ruins of Molaesmyr]].

## Clues and Information
- We learn from [[Heddy Hobleham]] in [[Uralis]] that there is a coven of hags that is the source of the corruption. It is their [[Hag's Eye]] that we have in the box. The eye is powerful.
- The corruption doesn't like the [[Blooming Grove]] or sunlight/ the sun shard

In Molesmyr there was someone who found a magic mace from the betrayers. [[Bane]]. It was imbued with the soul of a great fiend. The fiend exerted his will over the adventurer. He sought assistance, looking for a way to break the mace and be rid of it. But he didn't think through the situation. 
	According to the hags, the partially destroyed arm of the betrayers destroyed [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]] and the hags took that power to create the corruption and gain power.
## Outstanding Questions
- What is up with the Ruby of Power? Who or what is it? 
- What was the Arm of Bane and how did the hags use it to cause the corruption
