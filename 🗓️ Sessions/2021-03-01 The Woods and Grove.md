## O talks to Lyra
O: “I wonder if we could get to know eachother a bit yes?
Lyra sighs and says sure lets get to know eachother
“this is going better than I anticipated” “ So I take it that you found what you were looking for?”
Lyra says: I suppose so yes
O: If you could have any super magical ability what would it be:
Lyra: Flight, and you?
O: The exact same thing :)
O: can I ask: Who are you and like what’s your whole deal so to speak?
Lyra: “Has Faem not mentioned Me? let’s not get into that. I’m the protector of Nogvurot
came seeking help.
O: But you are still here, which means you have some hope for success? 
Lyra: large numbers this is convenient.
O: Sorry that we have so much going on, but I really do care. I am curious about your connection with Faem, you see they are a very interesting case study in morality.

It’s ok if you don’t want to talk about yourself and your whole thing, especially since we haven’t been able to help so far. 
## Brawny Awl
Dinner with Lyra, Elfa, Hekud and Mug
Crownsguard had been replaced by mercenaries
Lyra couldn’t even get council with him ([[Lord Alastair Renkorr|Renkorr]])
There is a gloom hanging over the city
not chaos
Everything ok by the book, but something can’t quite be right?
Makes no sense that she can’t see him
Can’t sneak around to figure out what is going on
Couldn’t find answers.
Met by guards, mercenaries and beurocrats 
There is a war going on. Guards are just mercenaries. maybe inside [[Nogvurot]]
## [[Savalier Wood]]
First Day normal
Second day twisted limbs and thick air
Black and purple thorny vines in brambles around trees and such
Things becoming quieter
Make our way through thicket in the woods
place where the canopy grew to mesh. Small Circle of mushrooms of strange shapes and different colors. Hear tinkling and strange lights floating around the mushrooms
One light floats down to land on the mushrooms, and notice it is a small winged human individual
This pixie comes up and touches Aust
aust becomes a fucking triceretops 
	Confusion ensues

It’s fine, Aust is just a triceretops now. it’ll wear off eventually

Ulfgar found cool plant to heal people of stuff

In morning I went scouting and found weird campsite

Tabaxi
	Nightback clan
	Also Elf, halfling, and orc 
	Also floating drum lute, 
I get stuck dancing in the charm, O saves me, casts silence, the other dancers die, we crush the instruments and are sad

O throws a rock and asks Eldath for help
	leads us to a bog
Then something wet and slimy grabs O and we fight
	Ted - a literal vine

We make all critical hits for some reason and destroy him
O rides a Aust as a triceretops

We run away and make it out after almost dying
We find a weird humanoid thing moves in and out of trees?
A dryad from the fey wild

Hummed a song together and it went great!
Most people fell into a pit with necrotic brambles
One set of foot prints small, light, humanoid, but clawed toes

Found a small goblin like creature selling fun magic potion
	[[Nibbles]] the goblin like thing was oily 
		Nibbles stole my toe
## Blooming Grove
we meet sweet Firbolg [[Caduceus Clay|Caduceus]]
	his mother was researching corruption but disappeared in the last few months
when mention corruption gets sombre 
he doesn’t know much about it
last of the blooming grove
makes good tea
berry bread
Caduceous’ father is dead from yeth hounds

mom = Aurelia
## [[Siobhan Byrch]]
elderly human in late 50s 
she her
dark walnut skin
Priest of Eldath
Knows O 
killed necromancer in o’s backstory
Only been in [[savalier wood]] for a few few weeks
After caduceus' mother disappeared
looking in to the sun shard
shard in the tower of the temple
discerning it’s properties
keeps the corruption at bay in the blooming grove
growing dimmer over time 
corruption encroaching
We are gonna clear out some of the vines but do it during the day to avoid the yeth hound
weirdly humanoid with yellow eyes and terrible howels
fey
[[Nibbles]] is a Fey boggle

Luxon 
	being of light, “god” of the crinn dynasty
	something about destiny and fate and stuff
	not “evil” as far as we know…
