Plan: hit the city to figure out what is going on
- What happened to the crownsguard?
- Heard of mercenary force now in the city?
- What is up with Alistair Renkorr?
In the city around 9. [[Lyra Thokk|Lyra]] expects to meetup by early afternoon communicated by cuffs of whispering 
I go to pedelars row

no outdoor sellers, no one milling about or chatting

righteous brand guards every few blocks. Very little space that there’s not a righteous brand guard

not tons of success trying to persuade others. Everyone is pretty suspicious. Everyone is a bit skittish/agresssive
one shopkeep a bit more chatty
general store
## [[Chad Bradson]]
The war is going on
making sure the guards can keep everyone safe.
The crownsguard 
word is that they were run out of the city/jailed

a ruckus between them and the righteous brand 3 years ago. looks like its the righteous brand held out making your peace here.

Chad has maybe some illicit activities and connections.

Atala and Mug walking around small horn looking for some street cats. Not finding scrappy

but they find a fluffy white house cat sitting on the windowsill. window is cracked open, and the cat is not actively running away.

## Ulfgar is talking to cat “[[Ms. Haversham]]”
Mummy and daddy and little george live here (george can be abrasive but she has claws lol)
Loves watching the birds
specifically loves the small tweety birds. 
Less shiny people before. There were less shimmery and shiny people at one point. 
Disgusting man who squacks and guacks who smells bottles of nasty milk. He walks down the streets crying and screaming sometimes. 
- Parents say “look how far he’s fallen” He lives down that direction. points to a place between smalhorn and the scatters
- That’s the way that the guards take him. 
- Name is Something like a bird. 
- Be on the look out for yellow birds and red birds. 
- Drunk is Robin Greck (old watchmaster)! 
## O Goes to the scatters
O doesn’t see any homeless people or scuffles with the guards on the street. Kinda Strange honestly
Only person that can really find that seems to be taking his time is halfling, dressed all in blue, with satchel jauntilly strolling down the street.
O is talking with halfling, [[Denny Bumblerock]]

should stop by and see marge in the central offices in the Aegis Block
Guard are getting a bit full of themselves in aegis block
heavily militarized.
“We’ve always had pigs squealing about” but not to this extent
big spout
- Listen, not a … stop by around 4-5 to talk a bit more about the goings on
## We try to meet with Robin and it goes to shit

We arrive at kings horn tavern

but Lyra not there
lyra screams in pain
blood 
she just cleft a man in twain. was a man that had been dressed nicely. but threadbare now

We lie to guards
3 “mercenary” guards take lyra 
they know who she is and that she killed Robin but we don’t know how they know her or what happened.

One thing that stands out:
not tons of blood on the ground. Some blood has dried? Maybe he died elsewhere/at another time.

The friend who told Lyra to find Robin at this bar might have set him up
- she never gave the name
Lyra was shaken. 
- In a “trance like state” but also shaken by having killed him
Maybe memory was altered, or was controlled.

Mercenaries perhaps, under the employ of Renkorr directly. 

Body is almost deffinitely a few hours old and in disturbing the body Lyra may have gotten some wet blood on her hands.

Questions: how does she have the sword that is supposed to be in the lockbox
- maybe mind control or memory
