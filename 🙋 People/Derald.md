## Description
A young orphan we met in [[Uthodurn]] who was dealing drugs and smuggling them through the [[Brawny Awl]] but we've hired him to be our accountant/spy. He had been pulling one over on [[Berrain Stonebrow]] who was acting as his drug mule getting drugs from the Brawny Awl into Uthodurn.
