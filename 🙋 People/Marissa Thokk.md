## Description
Orc woman. Commonly found in a pink dress and a bonnet. Had once been an incredibly accomplished fighter but became a horder after Lyra's dad died. She's still a badass though and after overthrowing the government of [[Nogvurot]] she and [[Lyra Thokk|Lyra]] went to the Pearlbow Wilderness together.
